Intro to Flask - Setup

Make a new directory called intro-to-flask, then enter this directory:

---
mkdir intro-to-flask
cd intro-to-flask
---

Initialize a new virtual environment inside your project directory and install Flask and Python’s PostgreSQL library:

---
pipenv install flask 
---

This command will create a new Pipfile and Pipfile.lock in your project directory, specifying Flask as a dependency.

Activate the virtual environment:

---
pipenv shell
---

AT THE END OF THE LESSON, to deactivate the virtual environment when you’re done, simply type:

---
exit
---

Open the contents of the directory in VSCode:
---
code .
